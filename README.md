### 📘 Solidity Smart Contract – Remix Project

## 📝 Overview

This project contains a smart contract written in **Solidity** and developed using **Remix IDE**.
The contract demonstrates fundamental blockchain concepts such as state variables, functions, validation, and data handling on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
